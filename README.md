# XML-Trees
This program moves input integers onto a heap and prints the heap in the form of xml as data is entered. It then deletes items from the heap 1 by 1 and prints each
integer as it is deleted as well as pushed it onto as stack. The program the pops each item from the stack and prints it out.

This program was made using the codeblocks ide, however all the source code is also available to be used.

Integers should be entered one by one and it will allow you to continue to enter integers until the end of file is reached. 
To simulate end of file in the command window enter cntrl+z on windows, and cntrl+d on linux.
